Biologia IV: Computational Neuroscience
======================================

Presentation about the Science Special Issue "Modelling the Mind" and correlated works, for the Biologia IV class.


## Definitions

1. **Stochastic** : In probability theory, a purely stochastic system is one whose state is non-deterministic (i.e., *random*) so that the subsequent state of the system is determined probabilistically. Any system or process that must be analyzed using probability theory is stochastic at least in part. Stochastic systems and processes play a fundamental role in mathematical models of phenomena in many fields of science, engineering, and economics. (Wikipedia)


### Neuronal Computations with Stochastic Network States

Spontaneous brain activity is generated by the combination of intrinsic electrophysiological properties of single neu- rons (1) and synaptic interactions in networks (2); it is dependent on the level of activation of neuromodulatory systems (3, 4)and is cor- related with the functional state of the brain (2)

Subtle variations in the spatiotemporal pattern of network activation strongly influ- ence information processing, and vice versa, sensory inputs modify ongoing activity

The complexity of network dynamics is beyond the reach of current recording methods and requires appropriate computational methods carefully constrained by biological data. Predictions from current modeling efforts are a critical guide for designing new experimental approaches.
